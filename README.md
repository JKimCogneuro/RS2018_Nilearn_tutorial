# RS2018_Nilearn_tutorial

A tutorial designed for the Resting State and Brain Connectivity 2018 satellite workshop:  "how to incorporate machine and deep learning in your data analysis"; September 29, 2018.

The tutorial will aim to show users the basics of Nilearn, how to use it to create connectomes out of resting state data and it use machine-learning analysis. We will (hopefully) include an example where we will predict age using an open rs-fmri dataset.
